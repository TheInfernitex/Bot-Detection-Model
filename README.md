# Twitter Bot Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect bots on Twitter using machine learning and NLP techniques. It classifies users as bots or humans based on tweet content, posting behavior, and engagement metrics.

## Features
- Text Analysis: TF-IDF, word embeddings, sentiment analysis
- Behavioral Analysis: Posting frequency, retweet patterns, mentions
- Machine Learning Models: BERT, RoBERTa, LSTMs, Isolation Forest, and Ensemble Learning
- Scalability: Supports big data processing with Apache Spark/Dask
- Privacy & Security: Anonymizes user data and encrypts stored information

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
User ID, Username, Tweet, Retweet Count, Mention Count, Follower Count, Verified Status, Bot Label, Location, Created At, Hashtags


## Setup Instructions

#### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```

#### Preprocess data
````bash
python preprocess.py```

#### Train the model
```bash
python train.py```

#### Evaluate performance
```bash
python evaluate.py```

#### Run bot detection
```bash
python detect.py --input sample_tweets.csv```

## Methodology
- Feature Extraction: Text-based (TF-IDF, embeddings), behavioral (posting patterns)
- Model Training: NLP-based classifiers, anomaly detection, ensemble learning
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC
- Deployment
The model can be deployed via Flask/FastAPI on cloud platforms or containerized with Docker.
